    <p class="about">
      Our guides cover two of the most popular and fertile waters in Arkansas.
      We offer adventures on both the White River and Beaver Lake. We specialize
      in Trophy Striped Bass on scenic Beaver Lake in Northwest Arkansas. We
      employ numerous full-time Beaver Lake Striper fishing guides. Some have
      been fishing Striped Bass on Beaver Lake for over 50 years. Being a
      professional bass guides over the years has provided us with unique
      insight to our striped bass fishery. It is our mission to provide our
      customers with the best experience they can possibly find anywhere for
      bass fishing. We specialize in providing our customers the best chance
      they can find anywhere in the world for a genuine Trophy Striped bass!
      Happy, smiling anglers with pictures of huge Beaver Lake striper is a
      primary motivation as we build lasting memories and relationships in the
      great outdoors with friends and family! The average Striped Bass anglers
      catch on Beaver Lake are 20 to 25lbs. But what makes Beaver Lake stand out
      from other striped bass fisheries is the opprotunity to capture a trophy
      Striper over 50lbs and even having a shot at stiper pushing triple digits.
      The state record is a 64-pound Striper. As such, our goal is to make one
      of our anglers the next record holder with a striper over 80lbs. You can
      also enjoy World class Fishing on the White River in Arkansas. Come join
      our Experienced Bass Fishing Guides for a day or more of unforgettable
      Bass Fishing. Fisherman from around the country come to the White River in
      Arkansas to enjoy world class fishing in clean, cold water. This is some
      of the best fishing water on the White River and some of the most scenic
      views in all of Arkansas. Large mouth, small mouth, striper, white,
      spotted, rock, Ozark, shadow, and many more bass species are all caught
      here. Arkansas has produced stiper bass up to 68lbs 4oz., with numerous
      others recorded in the fifty pound class. However it is not only the size,
      but also the variety of bass species that lure anglers from around the
      world to our fertile waters. The White River is one of the few spots in
      the world where you can stand in one spot and catch the coveted grand
      slam! A yellowbelly, a striper, a rock, and a cutthroat can all be caught
      right here on the White River. We can accommodate your needs from one
      fisherman to large groups and skill levels from novice to expert. Our
      guides here at the Bassholes Guide Services are familiar with the whole
      bass fishery but usually fish the first 65 miles or so, including the
      North Fork River. All of the guides here are experts in every aspect of
      fishing and customer service. Their sole purpose is to ensure your safety
      and to make certain that your White River experience is everything you
      expect. Our guides are not competing fishermen but are here to assist you
      as much or as little as you need to have a great time. From first time
      beginners to seasoned lifetime anglers, your enjoyment is our goal. We
      spare no effort to provide a safe, comfortable, and rewarding day on the
      water. With our years of experience in the industry, we have guides who
      have also proudly served on the board of directors for the NWASA, or the
      Northwest Arkansas Striper Association. In addition, we routinely
      collaborate with the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission helping with
      studies and regulation. Reserve your fishing trip today and experience a
      trip of a life time with safe, friendly, and experienced fishing guides!
